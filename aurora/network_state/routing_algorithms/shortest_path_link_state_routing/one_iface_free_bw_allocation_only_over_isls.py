    Calculates bandwidth and forwarding state (shortest paths via ISLs only, no GS relaying)
    and returns them as state objects, without writing to files.

    Assumptions:
    - "one": Each satellite/GS has one GSL interface (index 0).
    - "free": Bandwidth is managed per interface, and there is no strict requirement that
      bandwidth usage is reciprocated between nodes. Each node's interface tracks its own
      available bandwidth independently, allowing for flexible allocation without enforcing
      that if Node A can send to Node B, Node B must also be able to send to Node A.
    - "only_over_isls": Paths are GS -> Sat -> ... -> Sat -> GS.

    :param time_since_epoch_ns: Current time step relative to epoch (integer ns).
    :param constellation_data: Holds satellite list, counts, max lengths, epoch string.
    :param ground_stations: List of GroundStation objects.
    :param topology_with_isls: LEOTopology object containing the graph with ISL links calculated.
                               Also contains ISL interface mapping (sat_neighbor_to_if).
    :param gsl_attachment_strategy: Strategy for selecting which satellites are visible to each ground station.
    :param current_time: Current simulation time for satellite positioning.
    :param list_gsl_interfaces_info: List of dicts, one per sat/GS, with bandwidth info.
    :param prev_output: Dictionary containing 'fstate' and 'bandwidth' objects from the previous step.
    :param enable_verbose_logs: Boolean to enable detailed logging.
    :return: Dictionary containing the new 'fstate' and 'bandwidth' state objects.
