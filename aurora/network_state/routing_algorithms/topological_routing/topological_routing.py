    """
    Routing algorithm using topological routing (ISLs only, no GS relaying).

    This algorithm implements topological routing with the following key features:
    - Assigns 6GRUPA addresses to all satellites at t=0
    - Populates forwarding tables based on topological neighbor relationships
    - Handles satellite-to-ground-station routing without GS relays
    - Supports both direct GSL connections and multi-hop ISL paths
