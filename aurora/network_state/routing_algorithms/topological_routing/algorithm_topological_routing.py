    Calculates bandwidth and forwarding state using topological routing over ISLs only (no GS relaying).

    This algorithm implements topological addressing with 6GRUPA addresses and uses neighbor-based
    forwarding tables combined with shortest-path routing for satellite-to-ground-station communication.

    Args:
        time_since_epoch_ns: Current time step relative to epoch (integer ns).
        constellation_data: Holds satellite list, counts, max lengths, epoch string.
        ground_stations: List of GroundStation objects.
        topology_with_isls: LEOTopology object containing the graph with ISL links calculated.
        gsl_attachment_strategy: Strategy for selecting which satellites are visible to each ground station.
        current_time: Current simulation time for satellite positioning.
        list_gsl_interfaces_info: List of dicts, one per sat/GS, with bandwidth info.
        prev_fstate: Previous forwarding state (for optimization)
        graph_has_changed: Whether topology graph has changed since last computation

    Returns:
